The logic of the application is very simple, every time the user refreshes the page two attributes are chosen at random a power and a publisher. Depending on these two attributes a hero is selected at random from a list. Each character has a different chance of being chosen.

<b> analysis </b>

In terms of improvements the project was more intended for display of codependency with the implementation tools rather than the python application. Nonetheless I would have liked to improve upon the simplicity of the applications logic. Currently there is only eight possible outcomes I would have liked to ideally expand on that,  Some of the code implementation I would have changed or tidied up. Ultimately time constraints were the deciding factor.
